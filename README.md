# Over or Under Game Simulator
This repository contains a Python script that simulates the "Over or Under" card game and visualizes the results using pandas and matplotlib.

## Description
The "Over or Under" game is a simple card game where players draw cards from a deck. The goal is to draw cards in ascending order, and each consecutive round won increases the player's score. This script simulates multiple games of "Over or Under" and calculates the win percentages for each round.

## Requirements
To run the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/over-or-under.git
```
2. Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd over-or-under
```
3. Run the script:
```bash
python over_or_under.py
```
The script will simulate multiple games of "Over or Under" and output the win percentages for each round. It will also generate a bar plot visualizing the results and save it as over_or_under.png.
## Example Output
```shell
           %
round_1  63.439
round_2  39.838
